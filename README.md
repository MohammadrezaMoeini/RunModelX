 Verification, validation, optimization and regression of numerical simulation


This is a platform for verification, validation, optimiztion and regression of 
numerical simulation. 



 ## Verification step:
 In the verification module, you can make sure that your result is mathematically
 correct. This module is divided to five sub-sections:
 * Convergence study
 * Sensitivity analysis 
 * Boundary conditions verification,
 * Post-processing fucntions
 * Regression functions
 
 
 ## Validation step:
 In the verification module, you can make sure that your result is physically
 correct.
 * Regression functions for validation (move coordinate sys.) 
 * Compute relative difference 
 * Force-displacement function
 
 
 
 ## Optimization step:
 In the optimization step, there are two main sub-sections:
 * Gradient-based optimization
 * Derivative-free optimization (black box optimization)
 * Convergence study
 * Plot functions
 
 
 
 ## Regression (Machine learning) step:
 In the machine learning step, after you verified and validated the predictions 
 of your model then you can expand your data set using machine learning. Thus, this
 section is more related to the regression in supervised learning.
